\label{Introduction} %Allows referencing titles with \ref 

This document presents author guidelines and formatting requirements for thesis defended at the Faculty of Information Technology at Tallinn University of Technology. These requirements are obligatory for all bachelor’s and master’s thesis (further referred as thesis). Sections 1 and 2 of this document constitute formatting requirements whereas Sections 3 and 4 provide helpful hints for word processing with MS Word and LibreOffice Writer correspondingly. Authors are strongly advised to familiarize with Sections 1 and 2 before starting to write thesis. This document is formatted according to the requirements declared in this document, and acts as an example of correct formatting.

\subsection{Authors’ toolkit}

Authors are encouraged to download and use the templates prepared to ensure correct formatting of thesis. Templates are available for Word processing programs MS Word (version 2013 and newer) and LibreOffice Writer (version 5 and newer). The authors’ toolkit is downloadable as a single archive file in ZIP-format.

The toolkit contains guidelines and templates to compose thesis in Estonian or in English. Authors should download the toolkit file, and unzip it to their computer to a folder of their choice. The toolkit archive contains the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Author guidelines and formatting requirements document (PDF)  
    \item \textbf{MS Word templates:}
    	\begin{itemize}
          \item Template with predefined styles, thesis 
          		structure and title page \\
                (FIT\_template\_with\_structure\_ENG.dotx);
          \item Template with predefined styles and title \\
          		page only (FIT\_template\_ENG.dotx);
    	\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LibreOffice templates:}
     	\begin{itemize}
            \item Template with predefined styles, thesis 
            	  structure and title page \\
                  (FIT\_template\_with\_structure\_ENG.ott).
      	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To create a new text document based on the template authors should open it by double- clicking on the template file name. Opening template file with the Open command opens the template for editing.

\subsection{General formatting requirements}

Thesis must be formatted on an A4 page (210 x 297 mm), with margins from left and right set to 30 mm, and top and bottom 25 mm. The content text layout is in one column.

The thesis \textbf{font} is \textit{Times New Roman} 12 pt \textit{Regular}. Correct formatting of text is ensured with the use of the style \textit{Body Text} that has the following properties: \textit{Times New Roman} 12 pt \textit{Regular}, line spacing 1.5, spacing after 12 pt, text alignment \textit{Justify}. The style \textit{Body Text} is based on style \textit{Normal}. Table 1 lists all the requirements for different document parts and styles available in the template to ensure correct formatting.

Words or sentences which need highlighting can be presented as double-spaced, in \textbf{Bold} or \textit{Italic} (e.g., expressions in foreign language).

The font colour of the paragraphs and headings is black. The use of colours on figures is not limited.
The content of the thesis is structured into sections using up to three levels of headings. Adding a new level is justified if it contains more than one paragraph of text. The use of level 4 headings (\textit{Heading 4}) must be avoided. First level headings (\textit{Heading 1}) always start a new page. Headings are numbered using Arabic numerals. Multilevel headings contain a reference to higher level heading, whereas the numbers are separated by a dot.

As an exception the following headings are not numbered: Author’s declaration of originality, Abstract (\textit{Annotatsioon},\textcolor{red}{[Russian is not supported in this document yet!]}  %\textit{Aннотация} 
), List of abbreviations and terms, Table of contents, List of figures, List of tables, References, Appendixes. Headings for appendixes always start with a word \textit{Appendix}, which is followed by a number (or a letter), no automatic numbering is applied.

\textbf{Correct formatting of headings} is ensured with the use of styles available in the template: \textit{Heading 1}, \textit{Heading 2}, and \textit{Heading 3}.

\subsection{Formatting requirements and styles available in templates}

To ensure correct formatting of thesis and help authors in this process the templates contain different style definitions applicable for different document parts. These styles are based on the style \textit{Normal}: \textit{Times New Roman} 12 pt, \textit{Regular}, space before and after 0 pt, spacing \textit{Single}. Table \ref{Tab:formatting1} lists document parts and styles defined for their correct formatting together with the requirements.

\subsection{Thesis volume}

The volume of bachelor’s thesis main content should remain in the range of 25 to 35 pages, and for master’s thesis in between 30 to 60 pages. The main content does not include the title page, abstract, table of contents, list of references and appendices.

Despite the given ranges, the number of pages of the main content of the thesis should be as large as necessary and as small as possible. The text must be presented concisely and
the excess number of pages is permissible only in well-justified cases.
