abstract = {An important observation of GNSS-R is Delay-Doppler mapping (DDM). According to the requirement of GNSS-R signal real-time processing, a fast processing algorithm of GNSS-R signal based on double block zero padding (DBZP) and frequency domain rotation transformation is proposed for DDM generation. The reflected data is blocked and then correlated, which avoids the FFT calculation with too long points. The block and zero padding operations not only guarantee the full search of the pseudo code phase, but also avoid the repetitive calculation. In the frequency domain, the correlation results at different Doppler frequencies are approximated by the rotation transformation method, which avoids a large number of carrier multiplication operations and effectively reduces the computational burden. The computational burden and computational loss of parallel code phase correlation algorithm and fast algorithm are analyzed. Finally, the simulation time-consuming and processing results were compared. The results show that the fast algorithm greatly shortens the DDM generation time and the loss ofthe processing result is small.},

@article{Gleason2015,
abstract = {The CYGNSS satellite constellation consists of eight satellites equipped with GNSS bi-static radar receivers which map the ocean surface scattered signal power in the vicinity of the specular reflection point using time domain and Doppler frequency filters. The satellites orbit in the same plane at an altitude of 500 km and at a orbit inclination of 35 degrees. CYGNSS will act as a GNSS bi-static scatterometer capable of sensing sea level winds in tropical cyclones, including in high precipitation conditions. An overview of the GNSS remote sensing concept is included in this paper. Subsequently, an overview of the Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument (DDMI) carried by all of the CYGNSS observatories will be presented. The DDMI uses GPS forward scattered signals of opportunity to produce delay Doppler maps (DDMs) of the scattered signal delay and frequency spreading over the surface. This paper will conclude with results from preliminary laboratory testing of the CYGNSS instrument engineering models.},

@article{Komjathy2004,
abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) signals reflected from the ocean surface can be used for various remote sensing purposes. Some possibilities include measurements of surface roughness characteristics from which the rms of wave slopes, wind speed, and direction could be determined. In this paper, reflected GPS measurements that were collected using aircraft with a delay mapping GPS receiver are used to explore the possibility of determining ocean surface wind speed and direction during flights to Hurricanes Michael and Keith in October 2000. To interpret the GPS data, a theoretical model is used to describe the correlation power of the reflected GPS signals for different time delays as a function of geometrical and sea-roughness parameters. The model employs a simple relationship between surface-slope statistics and both a wind vector and wave age or fetch. Therefore, for situations when this relationship holds there is a possibility of indirectly measuring the wind speed and the wind direction. Wind direction estimates are based on a multiple-satellite nonlinear least squares solution. The estimated wind speed using surface-reflected GPS data collected at wind speeds between 5 and 10 m s−1 shows an overall agreement of better than 2 m s−1 with data obtained from nearby buoy data and independent wind speed measurements derived from TOPEX/Poseidon, European Remote Sensing (ERS), and QuikSCAT observations. GPS wind retrievals for strong winds in the close vicinity to and inside the hurricane are significantly less accurate. Wind direction agreement with QuikSCAT measurements appears to be at the 30° level when the airplane has both a stable flight level and a stable flight direction. Discrepancies between GPS retrieved wind speeds/directions and those obtained by other means are discussed and possible explanations are proposed.},

@article{Harmon1999,
abstract = {Mars radar imaging results from Arecibo 12.6-cm observations are presented. The images were derived from delay-Doppler mapping using a coded-long-pulse technique to mitigate the effects of echo overspreading. Images of the depolarized echo are used to identify regions of high decimeter-scale roughness. Some of the strongest echo features are located on the major shield volcanoes or on relatively young off-shield flows such as the Olympus and Pavonis lava aprons. The shields themselves have highly irregular radar signatures suggesting complex volcanic histories. Some Mars radar features have twice the depolarized brightness of the roughest terrestrial lava flows, apparently due to higher levels of multiple scattering from surfaces of spectacular roughness or from volume scattering. Low-brightness (smooth) areas are associated with older surfaces such as fractured and highland terra, as well as with terrain interpreted to be debris lobes, ash flows, and aureoles; in particular, a close connection was found between the 12.6-cm counterpart of the "Stealth" feature and the Medusae Fossae Formation (postulated to be deep ignimbrite deposits). Marte Vallis is anomalous in being the only outflow channel showing strongly enhanced echoes, which supports the idea that this channel and the Elysium Basin that it drained are filled with lava flows. A weak radar feature was found for the south polar residual ice cap. Comparisons with Goldstone 3.5-cm data show that the south polar enhancement is much weaker at 12.6 cm than at 3.5 cm, indicating that the southern ice cap becomes optically thin at the longer wavelength. A north polar enhancement has also been found, which is comparable in strength to the 12.6-cm south polar feature.},

@article{Martin-Neira1993,
abstract = {To date, altimetry from space has mainly been limited to nadir-looking-type instruments because of the difficulty of realising a precise wide-swath radar altimeter. A concept is presented that can be used to perform altimetry measurements over points along directions other than nadir, by making use of a passive instrument. The method is applied here to ocean altimetry in particular. This concept, based on the existence of sources of opportunity, consists of combining the direct signal and the signal that is reflected by the Earth's surface to obtain the desired measurement. It can be regarded as a multistatic radar for which the transmitters and the receivers belong to different systems. Because of the combination of direct and reflected signals, this concept has been called the "Passive Reflectometry and Interferometric System' (PARIS).},

@article{Zavorotny2000,
abstract = {A theoretical model that describes the power of a scattered Global Positioning System (GPS) signal as a function of geometrical and environmental parameters has been developed. This model is based on a bistatic radar equation derived using the geometric optics limit of the Kirchhoff approximation. The waveform (i.e., the time-delayed power obtained in the delay-mapping technique) depends on a wave-slope probability density function, which in turn depends on wind. Waveforms obtained for aircraft altitudes and velocities indicate that altitudes within the interval 5-15 km are the best for inferring wind speed. In some regimes, an analytical solution for the bistatic radar equation is possible. This solution allows converting trailing edges of waveforms into a set of straight lines, which could be convenient for wind retrieval. A transition to satellite altitudes, together with satellite velocities, makes the peak power reduction and the Doppler spreading effect a significant problem for wind retrieval based on the delay-mapping technique. At the same time, different time delays and different Doppler shifts of the scattered GPS signal could form relatively small spatial cells on sea surface, suggesting mapping of the wave-slope probability distribution in a synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) fashion. This may allow more accurate measurements of wind velocity and wind direction},
